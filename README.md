ðŸ“„ About the Project

This project is a single-page resume website created using basic HTML. It showcases my:

- Career summary & objective
- Education background
- Work experience across HR, analytics, and retail
- Skills, certifications, and achievements
- Hobbies and contact details

The goal was to build a clean, well-structured HTML document without CSS frameworks or JavaScriptâ€”focusing purely on semantic HTML and layout fundamentals.
